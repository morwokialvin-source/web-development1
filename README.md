## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(or whatever your languages are)*  
- Python  
- Git & GitHub  
- Any other tools used during the bootcamp

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repo
The goal of this repository is to:
- Keep my work safe online  
- Track my learning progress  
- Practice using GitHub  
- Build confidence in version control  

## 📄 How to View My Work
You can open each folder or file to see the code.  
Some projects may have their own README or instructions on how to run them.
