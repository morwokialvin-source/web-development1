<h1 style="color: red;"><i>The King of the jungle</i></h1> 
<p>  
My favorite animal is the lion. It is known as the king of the jungle, not because it 
is the biggest or the fastest animal, but because of its courage and leadership. The 
lion teaches us an important lesson:<u> you do not have to be the biggest person in 
programming to succeed. You just need to be brave, keep learning, and believe in 
yourself.</u> That is how you become a champion in anything you do. Click <a href="Lion.html">here</a> to 
see a picture of a <b>lion</b>.</P>
